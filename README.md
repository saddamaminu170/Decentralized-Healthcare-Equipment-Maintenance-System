# Decentralized Healthcare Equipment Maintenance

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, reliable, and compliant medical equipment maintenance management.

## Overview

The Decentralized Healthcare Equipment Maintenance platform leverages blockchain technology to transform how healthcare facilities manage, track, and verify the maintenance of critical medical equipment. By creating an immutable record of equipment history, maintenance activities, technician credentials, and regulatory compliance, this solution ensures patient safety and equipment reliability while streamlining administrative processes and supporting audit readiness.
